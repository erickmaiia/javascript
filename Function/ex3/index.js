/* Exercise 3
Create 4 functions, each one must receive two numeric parameters and return the value of one of the basic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication and division).

Then ask the user to input two numbers and call these 4 functions with those user-input values being the argument. Finally, print to the console the result of operations */
