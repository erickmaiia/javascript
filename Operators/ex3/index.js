/* Write the following logical operations in code format. Print to the console whether the value of the operation is true or false:

a) 5 is greater than 20 and is also less than 2;

b) 5 is equal to 5 or is equal to “5”;

c) negation of twenty is greater than fifty

d) negation of (twenty is greater than fifty)

Example:

const operation1 = 20 < 50 && 50 > 90;
console.log(operation1);
/*false, because 50 is not greater than 90, hence we have true && false,
which returns false */

console.log(5 > 20 && 5 < 2);
console.log(5 === 5 || 5 === "5");
console.log(!20 > 50);
console.log(!(20 > 50));
