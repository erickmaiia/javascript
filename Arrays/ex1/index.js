/* Exercise 1
In the first exercise we will practice creating arrays. Create 3 different arrays:

The first must have only numbers, and these numbers must not be in any particular order;
The second array must contain only strings;
The third array must contain numbers, strings and booleans. Print each of the above arrays using console.log() */

const array1 = [1, 2, 3];
const array2 = ["Pizza", "Hamburguer", "Pie"];
const array3 = [1, "Pizza", 4 > 3];
console.log(array1);
console.log(array2);
console.log(array3);
